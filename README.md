# greenhack-tcycle
T-Cycle, a mobile app where users can upload and return their unused electronic devices &amp; e-waste with ease. Users get T-Mobile credits as a reward. They can also see the environmental impact of their actions. Return can be done in three ways: T-Mobile Branch, Collection Point, and Mail. Users can exchange the credits with vouchers or cellular usage. T-Cycle also includes gamification of environmental impact where users can get additional benefit if they reach a certain amount of impact.

You can access the published demo-app here.
